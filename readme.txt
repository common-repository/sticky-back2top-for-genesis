Adds a sticky icon to any WordPress site, gently returning users to the top. Works on all themes, but optimized for Genesis. 

== DESCRIPTION ==

You've got a page. It's a long page. Heck, it might be your *only* page, you hipster single-page website rocking rebel you. Even if your page doesn't seem that long to you, believe me, someone out there is scrolling through it on a Nokia or some other tiny, difficult to use device and is getting frustrated because they have to scroll all the way back manually.

Do you hear that sound? No, it's not the sound of millions of scrollbars being exercised - it's the sound of your visitors leaving your site because they can't scroll back to the top.

Save your users from that nightmarish descent into scrolled hell. Save yourself from the pain of angry and lost customers. Install the Sticky Back2Top plugin from 43Folders today!

== FEATURES & CUSTOMIZATION ==

Sticky Back2Top Universal - Optimized for Genesis is easily and extremely customizable, if your definition of "extremely" is about 3 things, anyways.

= Current Options =
*   Select any background color
*   Choose from several types of embedded images (defaults to the classic 'up arrow' look) - or none at all!
*   Choose location to stay sticky (useful if your visitors are typically right-to-left language readers)
*   Adjust size from small, to medium, all the way up to ... wait for it ... large! That's nearly as big as Venti, but minus the pretenciousness.
*   Preview selection before activating

= Coming Soon =
*   Add your own images
*   Customize size more granularly
*   Allow for different opacity of images
*   Allow different background shapes
*   Dark mode pointers for a lightly colored background

== INSTALLATION ==

1. Unzip and upload files to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.  
2. Activate the plugin in the "Plugins" administration page.

Upgrade normally, either by overwriting existing files or through the Wordpress updater.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q: Why is the sticky arrow hidden by my widgets or other page content? =

A: The CSS z-index of the sticky arrow is set to 9999, so it should sit on top of everything. If it doesn't, it could be that your widget or other content has a z-index of 9999 also - in that case, set it to 9998 or less.   

= Q: Does this work if I'm using a Genesis theme? =

A: YES! Not only does it work, but the loading of the sticky arrow is specifically optimized for the Genesis hooks and initialization if you are using a Genesis child theme, meaning faster load times.  

= Q: I've heard of Genesis before, and it sounds cool - where can I find it? =

A: If you're interested, you can find out more about Genesis and StudioPress here: http://goo.gl/hE5B7F
Even if you already have Genesis, I would highly recommend the Minimum Pro theme - I use it for nearly all my clients because of its flexibility.

= Q: I don't have time to mess around with stuff like that, can I just hire you to make a nice site for me? =

A: Of course! You can either email me directly at michael@43folderstech.net or visit my website and portfolio at http://43folderstech.net Thanks!

= Q: I've already got Genesis, don't need to hire you for anything, but I do stil want to show some appreciation for doing this. What do you suggest? =

A: Can I tell you I love you?  Not in a romantic or creepy way (OK, if I'm completely honest here maybe a little creepy), but I do. Here's where you can buy me a coffee, or lunch or something:  http://paypal.me/43folders

2. Easily match your site color themes.
